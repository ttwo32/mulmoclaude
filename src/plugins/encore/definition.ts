// MCP ToolDefinition for `manageEncore`. The argument shape is a

// file (`config/helps/encore-dsl.md`) which the host syncs into the
// workspace at every startup — keeping this `description` short and
// letting Claude lazy-read the help file for full grammar is the
// teaching strategy (see plans/feat-encore-plugin.md "Teaching the
// DSL to Claude").
