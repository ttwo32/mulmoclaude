// On-disk per-cycle state holds only DATA, not status flags:

//   - skipped — explicit "this target is opted out for this cycle"
//   - completedSteps[stepId] — timestamp set by markStepDone
//
// "Closed" is derived from those three. There's no `status: closed`
// field anywhere; if there were, it could disagree with the data
// (and did, in the original landing — bug fixed by this refactor).
