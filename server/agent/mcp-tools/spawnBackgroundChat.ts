// `spawnBackgroundChat` launches a SECOND, parallel chat session via
// the host's `startChat` (each session is its own `claude`
// subprocess, so the worker runs genuinely concurrently with the
// caller's conversation — unlike Claude Code's blocking `Task`
// subagent). It's a generic primitive: any role/skill can use it to
// do work off the critical path (the first consumer is the
// lessons-collection recipe, which pre-authors the next lesson's HTML
// while the learner reads the current one).
//
// `startChat` is already fire-and-forget — it kicks off
// `runAgentInBackground` (not awaited) and returns once the run is
// launched — so this handler returns the new `chatId` immediately
// without waiting for the worker to finish.
//
// `hidden` controls whether the user ever sees the spawned session:
//   - true  → origin `system`; excluded from every session listing
//             (no sidebar entry under any filter). For invisible
//             plumbing like artifact pre-generation.
//   - false → origin `skill`; a normal visible chat, reachable under
//             the "Skill" history filter. For when the user should be
//             able to open the spawned chat.
//
// Deps are injected so the unit test can assert the origin mapping,
// the no-nesting refusal, and the concurrency cap without spawning
// real subprocesses.
