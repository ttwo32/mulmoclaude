// Custom Marp themes (#1649). One `.css` file per theme under
// `config/marp-themes/`; filename (sans `.css`) is the registered
// theme name and the slug used by a slide deck's frontmatter
// `theme: <name>`. Loaded into the shared Marp themeSet by both
// the client previewer (`MarpView.vue`) and the server PDF route
// (`renderMarpPdf` in `routes/pdf.ts`), so a theme that renders in
// the previewer renders identically in the export.
